# FABLAB_BOT
DIY kit for an USB powered vibration robot. Perfect for an afternoon of fun with kids.
Once the board is assembled you can stick it in small cardboard boxes, glue feet on the boards, 3D print a housing,... to make the board in a vibration powered robot.

The board charges a supercap (designed for a 2.7V 5F capacitor) when plugged in to a USB port. Then the switch is turned on the motor will start to vibrate. This vibration can be used to propel the robot. On a full charge you'll get more than 2 minutes of vibration.
