Perfect for an afternoon of fun with kids.\r\nOnce the board is assembled you can stick it in small cardboard boxes, glue feet on the boards, 3D print a housing,... to make the board in a vibration powered robot.\r\n\r\n## Rev 00\r\n\r\n![FABLAB_BOT_00](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/FABLAB_BOT/master/FABLAB_BOT_00/3D_VIEW_TOP.png)\r\n\r\nThe board charges a supercap (designed for a 2.7V 5F capacitor) when plugged in to a USB port. Then the switch is turned on the motor will start to vibrate. This vibration can be used to propel the robot. On a full charge you'll get more than 2 minutes of vibration.\r\n\r\n## Rev 01\r\n\r\n![FABLAB_BOT_01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phyx-be/FABLAB_BOT/master/FABLAB_BOT_01/3D_VIEW_TOP.png)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- changed board outline\r\n- allows assembly variant with a larger vibration motor\r\n- Fits multiple sizes of capacitors\r\n\r\n## Assembly instructions\r\n\r\n- [Board revision 00, Dutch instructions](doc/FABLAB_BOT_00_NL)\r\n- [Board revision 00, English instructions](doc/FABLAB_BOT_00_EN)",
